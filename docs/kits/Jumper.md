#### **Translocator**
## Translocator
Right click to throw a translocator in the direction the player is looking. After `{{ kits.jumper.data.JUMPER_TRANSLOCATOR_AFTER_THROW_COOLDOWN }}` ticks, the player can right click again to teleport to it. The player must be within `{{ kits.jumper.data.JUMPER_TRANSLCOATOR_TELEPORT_DISTANCE }}` meters of the translocator to teleport to it. If `JUMPER_TRANSLOCATOR_SILENT_TELEPORT` is set to `true`, then the player will be silent when teleporting.
