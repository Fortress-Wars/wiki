## Divination Star
Right click to throw a star. When it hits an enemy, it will tag them with [Future Sight](#future-sight). If `ILLUSIONIST_DIVINATION_STAR_DO_DISORIENTATION` is set to `true`, then tagging an enemy will also make them look in a random direction.

#### **Future Sight**
## Future Sight
An enemy tagged with futue sight will take `x{{ kits.illusionist.data.ILLUSIONIST_DIVINATION_STAR_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER_ADDITIVE }}` more damage if the damage source is from the player that tagged them. When future sight expires, it will also deal `{{ kits.illusionist.data.ILLUSIONIST_FUTURE_SIGHT_DAMAGE }}` damage.

#### **Fake Death**
## Fake Death
When the player takes a fatal attack from the enemy tagged with [Future Sight](#future-sight), they will fake their death. When the player fakes their death, they will heal `{{ kits.illusionist.data.ILLUSIONIST_FAKE_DEATH_HEALING }}` HP, cloak and turn invisible for `{{ kits.illusionist.data.ILLUSIONIST_FAKE_DEATH_INVISIBILITY_DURATION }}` ticks, be pushed back, and lose all of their healing potions. A death message will also appear in the chat.

The player will uncloak if the duration expires or if they left click a block, or damage an enemy.
