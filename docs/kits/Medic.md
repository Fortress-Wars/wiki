#### **Medic Healing Potions**
## Medic Healing Potions
Left-click or right-click to use. Just like regular potions, medic healing potions will restore a certain amount of health to the player. In addition, when the player consumes a medic healing potion, they will also restore `{{ kits.medic.data.MEDIC_POTION_SHARE_POTENCY }}` health to all nearby allies in a `{{ kits.medic.data.MEDIC_POTION_SHARE_RADIUS }}` meter radius.

#### **Healing Stone**
## Healing Stone
Right click and hold to use. The healing stone is used to heal nearby allies in a `{{ kits.medic.data.MEDIC_HEALING_STONE_RADIUS }}` meter radius. Using the healing stone converts [Electrolytes](#electrolytes) to health at a 1:1 ratio. The maximum number of electrolytes that can be converted in a single instance of healing is `{{ kits.medic.data.MEDIC_HEALING_STONE_POTENCY }}`. The player can use the healing stone ability every `{{ kits.medic.data.MEDIC_HEALING_STONE_HEAL_RATE }}` ticks. However, the player can only heal themselves once every `{{ kits.medic.data.MEDIC_HEALING_STONE_SELF_HEAL_RATE }}` ticks.
