# Health Bars
_Introduced: v2.0.0_
***

### Overview
Health Bars show how much health a player has. They are shown below the player's name and are only shown to other allies. The health bar includes two numbers. The number on the left (`20.00` in the image below), shows the numerical value of health. The number of the right (`7` in the image below), shows how many healing potions the player has.
